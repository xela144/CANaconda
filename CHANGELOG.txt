CHANGED:

 * Allow for reloading xml file while receving data.
 * When starting operation, added check for either T or t to indicate a new message
 * Now showing ID XOR PGN in metadata viewer
 * removed the word 'comports()' from first item in comports menu
 * Limited precision of floats to 3 decimal places in message stream window
 * Changed the name of parsedmsg to matchedmsg, due to parsedmsg being a regex 
   Match Object. parsedmsg is confusing because 'parse' is part of the name of 
   a set of functions
 * created CANacondaMessage.py, CANacondaMessageParse.py, CANacondaFilter.py, 
   CANacondaFilterParse.py, and refactored backend.py, canport.py, and 
   canport_QT.py
 * Made code more modular
   + removed the message parsing from canpython.py

 * Made changes to namespace:
        self.filterList              --> messageInfoList
        self.filter_field_map        --> self.messageInfo_to_fields
        self.filter_id_map           --> self.id_to_name
        self.filter_pgn_map          --> self.pgn_to_name
        self.filterList              --> self.messageInfoList
        self.filtersFlag             --> self.messageInfoFlag
        self.filters                 --> self.messages
        self.filter_field_map_units  --> messageInfo_to_fields_units

 * Changed name of files: 
        CANacondaFilter.py      --> messageInfo.py
        CANacondaFilterParse.py --> messageInfoParse.py

 * Separated all GUI and command-line code. Encapsulated data structures and 
   their methods into individual files.

 * Removed 'displayCheckBox' from ui_mainwindow. Replaced with 'displayCombo', 
   and updated corresponding code.

 * Moved logging buttons to bottom of window. Now spans entire window
 * Changed "Begin Logging" button into "Start logging as CSV"

 * Made the 'filter by value' function more clear and less buggy. Still need to
   use mouseover functionality for help

 * Added hourglass for when serial connection is being established.

 * Added a status ("RECORDING" or "STOPPED"), followed by the number
   messages that have been recorded into each log session.

 * Added transmission to GUI. Need to make this code more modular

 * Fixed with 'dataFound = True': Raw message viewing in GUI is spewing 
   all messages even if none are selected in the table widget

 * Fixed another bug with raw messages always transmitting in GUI. Change was made
   in outmessage.py. For the function to return the raw message, check to see if 
   the GUI_rawFlag is True, and the messageInfo flag is False.

 * Fixed a bug with message processing.. all messages had a value of 0 due to a missing
   return value statement.

 * Added an error code explanation in canport.py

 * Added support for bitfield message types

 * Removed the flawed logic in outmessage.py, where 'if message.id:' would always be true
