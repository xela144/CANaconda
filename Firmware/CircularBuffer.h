 * @date   August, 2012
 * @brief  Provides a circular buffer implementation for bytes and non-primitive datatypes.
 *
 * This circular buffer provides a single buffer interface for almost any situation necessary. It
 * has been written for use with the dsPIC33f, but has been tested on x86.
 *
 * Unit testing has been completed on x86 by compiling with the UNIT_TEST_CIRCULAR_BUFFER macro.
 * With gcc: `gcc CircularBuffer.c -DUNIT_TEST_CIRCULAR_BUFFER`

 * memory space pointed to by `data`.
 *
 * The useful properties are dataSize and overflowCount. Most of the other properties you probably
 * don't care about and shouldn't touch.

 * in the buffer, then STANDARD_ERROR is returned. This is also the case if the CircularBuffer
 * pointer is NULL. CB_PeakMany can also be used to peak a structure off the buffer.

 *   int64 a;

 *
 * This function is useful for removing data that has already been CB_Peek()d at. An example is with
 * the ECAN peripheral on the dsPICs where I CB_PeekMany() off entire CAN message structs:
 * ```
 * CanMessage cmsg;
 * CB_PeekMany(&b, &cmsg, sizeof(CanMessage));
 * Ecan1Transmit(&cmsg);

 * interrupt() {
